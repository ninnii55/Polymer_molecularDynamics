# Polymer_molecularDynamics
Various bits of code to set up and analyse polymer simulations

## Polymer_number_MD_V1
  Used to calculate how many individual polymers (w/v) and waters are required in a certain simulation box (cube). This currently only calculates the volume (cm^3) of a cubic system. Available in a notbook version (.ipynb) or python file (.py)
