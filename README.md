# Polymer_molecularDynamics
Various bits of code to set up and analyse polymer simulations

## Polymer_number_MD_V1
  Used to calculate how many individual polymers (w/v) and waters are required in a certain simulation box (cube). This currently only calculates the volume (cm^3) of a cubic system. Available in a notbook version (.ipynb) or python file (.py)

## Polymer_distribution_V1
python code to calcualte PDI of polymer solution in a molecualr dynamic simulation. Also, a number of pokymer generator to generate number of polymers to put in simulation according to (i) Gaussian distribution (ii) high Mw skewed distribution - Stokmeyer, and (iii) Bimodal distribution.
