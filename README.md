# Polymer_molecularDynamics
Various bits of code to set up and analyse polymer simulations

## Polymer_number (Folder) Polymer_number_MD_V1
  Directory that contains python code (Polymer_number_MD_V1), whic can be used to calculate how many individual polymers (w/v) and waters are required in a certain simulation box (cube). This currently only calculates the volume (cm^3) of a cubic system. Available in a notbook version (.ipynb) or python file (.py)

## Distribution_polymers (Folder)
python code (Polymer_distribution_V1.ipynb) to calcualte PDI of polymer solution in a molecualr dynamic simulation. Also, a number of pokymer generator to generate number of polymers to put in simulation according to (i) Gaussian distribution (ii) high Mw skewed distribution - Stokmeyer, and (iii) Bimodal distribution. This folder also includes associated papers for code inspiration.
